# CS-370
Final Project
The files in this repositories contain code for a project for my class CS-370.
The problem for this project is a maze that has an agent (pirate) that needs to get to the solution (treasure). 
The goal is to train this agent using Deep Q-Learning to reach the solution using the most efficient path. 
My part in this code was the Deep Q-learning algorithm that uses a neural network to estimate Q-values for action in each state, based on knowledge gained from previous trials. 


Computer scientists develop and improve software and hardware systems to solve problems, making technology work better and more efficiently in various sectors.
Their work is crucial because it drives advancements that affect nearly every aspect of modern life.
When tackling a problem, a computer scientist typically defines the problem, breaks it down, and then systematically works on solutions using programming and analytical skills.
They have ethical responsibilities to ensure their solutions are secure, privacy-respecting, and beneficial to both users and the organization.
By adhering to these ethical standards, they help ensure technology is used responsibly and for the greater good.
